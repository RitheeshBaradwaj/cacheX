# CacheX  

CacheX is a high-performance cache server written in **C and C++**, designed to explore **low-level programming, data structures, and scalable network systems**. This project is a hands-on approach to learning **efficient memory management, high-throughput networking, and system-level optimizations** while building a fast and lightweight caching solution.
